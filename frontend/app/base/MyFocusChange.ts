/** The DOM does not have an event that is triggered when the focused element
 * changes, indicating the old and the new element, so here it is...
 *
 * 'myfocuschange' event.
 *
 * "My" is a bit ambiguous in that it does not say whom it belongs, but one
 * thing is sure: not to W3C. That's probably enough to avoid a collision in
 * case at some point in the future the 'focuschange' event becomes a standard.
 *
 * This event is similar to monitoring `document.activeElement` (without the
 * overhead of polling).
 *
 * Requires a `setImmediate()` implementation. For instance:

 *   https://github.com/YuzuJS/setImmediate
